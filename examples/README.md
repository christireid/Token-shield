# Interactive Examples

## 🚀 Live Demo (Web)

We have a live interactive demo that simulates TokenShield's behavior (Cache, Cost Tracking) in a Next.js environment.

**[Launch in StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com/github/tokenshield/ai-sdk/tree/main/examples/interactive-demo)**

_(Note: Since this is a private repo/sandbox, you can verify the code in `examples/interactive-demo`)_

## 📦 How to Run Locally

1. **Navigate to the demo:**

   ```bash
   cd examples/interactive-demo
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the development server:**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Open in browser:**
   Go to http://localhost:3000

## 🧪 What's Included?

1. **Cost Simulator:** Click to send requests and see "Cache Hits" vs "API Calls".
2. **Real-time Ledger:** Watch your savings grow as the semantic cache kicks in.
3. **Latency Comparison:** See the difference between <5ms middleware and 450ms API calls.
